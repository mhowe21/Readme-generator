## Install
In order to run, download the files. Then you will need to install node JS. Once that is done use NPM install to install necessary packages. 

  ## Usage
Once the packages are installed you will want to use `node index.js` from the Development folder. You will be given a series of prompts. Any prompt that is not required can be skipped by hitting enter. Once all the promps are filled a README.md file will be generated in the develop folder.
